# Oded Masala â€“ Full Stack Engineer

At BioCatch, I develop web applications that detect and prevent fraud for banks around the globe.

As a former company commander in the Armored Corps, I bring discipline, collaboration, and a drive for excellence to every project.

Previously at Moveo Group, I partnered with product and design teams to ship user-centric interfaces using React, Angular, Node.js, MongoDB, and AWS in an agile environment.

My toolkit spans TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python, leveraging React, Node.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Snowflake, Docker, and AWS to deliver secure, scalable solutions.

Key projects include:  
- **Bio-Scouter**: real-time biometric analysis dashboard (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL)  
- **ChainChat**: LangChain chatbot framework with FastAPI and Docker  
- **Tilt-Setup**: automated Tilt + Docker local Kubernetes environment
